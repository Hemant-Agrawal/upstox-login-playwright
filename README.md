- npm or yarn
- Playwright browsers (will be installed automatically)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hemant-Agrawal/upstox-login-playwright.git
cd upstox-login-playwright
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

2. The API will be running on `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Using the Web Form (Recommended):**

   - Fill in the form with your credentials:
     - **Username**: Your Upstox mobile number
     - **Password**: Your 6-digit PIN
     - **OTP Secret**: Secret key for TOTP generation
     - **Client ID**: Upstox OAuth client ID
     - **Client Secret**: Upstox OAuth client secret
     - **Redirect URI**: OAuth redirect URI
   - Click Submit

4. **Using the API directly:**
   - Make a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/upstox` with the following JSON body:
   ```json
   {
     "username": "YOUR_MOBILE",
     "password": "YOUR_PIN",
     "otpSecret": "YOUR_SECRET",
     "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
     "redirect_uri": "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
   }
   ```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This project handles sensitive authentication credentials. Ensure that:
- The server is not exposed to public networks without proper security measures
- Credentials are never committed to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret management in production
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for the API endpoint
- Consider using HTTPS in production environments
