## Features

- üîê Automated Upstox login flow
- üì± Mobile number-based authentication
- üîë OTP generation using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
- üé≠ Headless browser automation with Playwright
- üöÄ RESTful API endpoint

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Playwright browsers (will be installed automatically)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hemant-Agrawal/upstox-login-playwright.git
cd upstox-login-playwright
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

2. The API will be running on `http://localhost:3000`

3. Make a GET request to the root endpoint with the following query parameters:
   - `username`: Upstox mobile number
   - `password`: 6-digit PIN
   - `otpSecret`: Secret key for OTP generation
   - `client_id`: Upstox OAuth client ID
   - `redirect_uri`: OAuth redirect URI

Example:
```
http://localhost:3000/?username=YOUR_MOBILE&password=YOUR_PIN&otpSecret=YOUR_SECRET&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
```
